# Password Generator Starter

## Usage

JavaScript

## Processs

This weeks code was given to us and we needed to add the JS to make the page work. For that reason, I only had the one develop branch and worked my code in that branch.

I started with my global arrays that would end up filling my password array "password_content"

I then made 2 main functions. The first fucntion was to make and randomize the password that was given to the user. This function called to my second fucntion which wiith given input from the user used "window.confirm" and an "if" statement to determine what characters would be in the password.

Lastly, I used a "for" loop to fill my password array with a random characater from the array created by the user.
